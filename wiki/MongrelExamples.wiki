= Mongrel Examples =

Mongrel supports many otions when creating, reading, updating or deleting documents. We show examples of using Mongrel from the Erlang shell. We assume that:
 * You have compiled the `book_database` module and that the BEAM file is available on the shell's path
 * You should execute `book_database:populate()` before executing these examples.
 * You should have at least some familiarity with the Monty Python bookshop sketch... Actually, not really

Examples:
 * CreateExamples
 * ReadExamples
 * UpdateExamples
 * DeleteExamples
