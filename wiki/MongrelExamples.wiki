= Mongrel Examples =

Mongrel supports many options for creating, reading, updating or deleting documents. This wiki has examples of using Mongrel from the Erlang shell. We assume that:
 * You have compiled the `book_database` module and that the BEAM file is available on the shell's path
 * You need to execute `book_database:add_mappings()` to allow the records specified in the `book_database` module to be mapped to documents
 * You should execute `book_database:populate()` before executing these examples.
 * You should run `rr(book_database)` to allow the records specified in the sample module to be available to the shell.
