= Update Modifiers =

MongoDB has the following modifiers for updating part of a document:

 * $set
 * $unset
 * $inc
 * $push
 * $pop
 * $pull
 * $each
 * $addToSet

Some care is needed when using modifiers with Mongrel and nested documents. Modifiers can be used to update a nested record only if the nested record does not have an '_id' field. If the nested document has an '_id' field, the nested document is not embedded in the outer document but stored in its own collection and cannot be updated by accessing the outer document.

For example, this code to add add review to "Olsen's Standard Book of British Birds" succeeds since the review being added is an embedded document
