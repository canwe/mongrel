= Update Modifiers =

MongoDB has the following modifiers for updating part of a document:

 * $set
 * $unset
 * $inc
 * $push
 * $pop
 * $pull
 * $each
 * $addToSet

Some care is needed when using modifiers with Mongrel and nested documents. Modifiers can be used to update a nested record only if the nested record does not have an '_id' field. If the nested document has an '_id' field, the nested document is not embedded in the outer document but stored in its own collection and cannot be updated by accessing the outer document.
