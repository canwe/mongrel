= Building Mongrel =

== Checking out the Source Code ==
The Mongrel source code can be checked out from the subversion repository using svn
{{{
svn checkout http://mongrel.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ mongrel
}}}

== Compiling the Code ==
Under Linux, the *make_mongrel.sh* can be used to build the project
{{{
cd mongrel
./make_mongrel.sh
}}}
The bash script compiles the code, runs the unit tests and creates a zip archive.

If someone wants to create a rebar or a sinan build file for mongrel, it would be appreciated.
