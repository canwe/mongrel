= Tumblelog Example =

The !MongoEngine <a href="http://mongoengine.org/docs/v0.5/tutorial.html">tutorial</a> illustrates mapping Python objects to MongoDB documents using a _tumblelog_ example. We assume that you've read through that tutorial before reading further here (in particular, it defines what a 'tumblelog' is).

== Differences between !MongoEngine and !MongrelMapper ==
=== Mongrel's Limitations===
The purpose of this example was to check that Mongrel can provide similar functionality to that of the !MongoEngine mapper. Mongrel has certain limitations compared to !MongoEngine at the moment
 # Mongrel doesn't enforce that certain fields in a record must be defined
 # Mongrel doesn't perform type-checking on the contents of fields
 # Mongrel doesn't support cascading deletes
 # Mongrel requires that if a document has an `_`id' field, that the `_`id field is populated by the user.

With varying levels of effort, the items above could probably be added to Mongrel.

===Embedded versus Reference Documents===
Both !MongoEngine and !MongrelMapper allow documents to be nested either by reference or by embedding. !MongoEngine requires that a document extend the !EmbeddedDocument class if it must be embedded. !MongrelMapper will embed a document unless it has an `_`id field.
