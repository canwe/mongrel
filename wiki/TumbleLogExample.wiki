= Tumblelog Example =

The !MongoEngine <a href="http://mongoengine.org/docs/v0.5/tutorial.html">tutorial</a> illustrates mapping Python objects to MongoDB documents using a _tumblelog_ example. We assume that you've read through that tutorial before reading further here (in particular, it defines what a 'tumblelog' is).

== Differences between !MongoEngine and !MongrelMapper ==
=== Mongrel's Limitations===
The purpose of this example was to check that Mongrel can provide similar functionality to that of the !MongoEngine mapper. Mongrel has certain limitations compared to !MongoEngine at the moment
 # Mongrel doesn't enforce that certain fields in a record must be defined
 # Mongrel doesn't perform type-checking on the contents of fields
 # Mongrel doesn't support cascading deletes
 # Mongrel requires that if a document has an `_`id' field, that the `_`id field is populated by the user.

With varying levels of effort, the items above could probably be added to Mongrel.

===Embedded versus Reference Documents===
Both !MongoEngine and !MongrelMapper allow documents to be nested either by reference or by embedding. !MongoEngine requires that a document extend the !EmbeddedDocument class if it must be embedded. !MongrelMapper will embed a document unless it has an `_`id field.

==Tumblelog Module==
TODO

==Running the sample code==
We can compile and run the sample code to populate the `tumblelog` database from the shell as follows

<pre>
1> application:start(mongodb).
ok
2> application:start(mongrel).
ok
3> c(tumblelog).
{ok,tumblelog}
4> rr(tumblelog).
[comment,image_post,link_post,post,text_post,user]
5> tumblelog:add_mappings().
ok
6> tumblelog:populate().
{ok,ok}
</pre>

==Reading from the Database==
===Getting the titles of all posts===
The following code shows how to retrieve the titles of all posts by getting a projection of the title field the posts.

<pre>
7> f(Conn).
ok
8> {ok,Conn}=mongo:connect(localhost).
{ok,{connection,{"localhost",27017},<0.66.0>,infinity}}
9> mongrel:do(safe, master, Conn, tumblelog, fun()->
9> Cursor=mongrel:find(#post{}, #post{'_id'=0, title=1}),
9> mongrel_cursor:rest(Cursor)
9> end).
{ok,[#post{'_id' = undefined,
           title = <<"Fun with MongoeEngine">>,author = undefined,
           tags = undefined,comments = undefined,body = undefined},
     #post{'_id' = undefined,
           title = <<"MongoEngine Documentation">>,author = undefined,
           tags = undefined,comments = undefined,body = undefined}]}
</pre>

===Retrieving posts of only one type===
The code snippet below shows how we can retrieve only text posts and then display (using a projection) only the content of the text post.

<pre>
10> f(Conn).                                              
ok
11> {ok,Conn}=mongo:connect(localhost).                   
{ok,{connection,{"localhost",27017},<0.73.0>,infinity}}
12> mongrel:do(safe, master, Conn, tumblelog, fun()->     
12> Cursor=mongrel:find(#post{body=#text_post{}}, #post{'_id'=0, body=#text_post{content=1}}),
12> mongrel_cursor:rest(Cursor)                                                 
12> end).     
{ok,[#post{'_id' = undefined,title = undefined,
           author = undefined,tags = undefined,comments = undefined,
           body = #text_post{content = <<"Took a look at mongoengine today, looks pretty cool.">>}}]}
</pre>

===Finding posts by tag===
The code below shows how we can count all posts that have been tagged with 'mongodb'.

<pre>
13> f(Conn).                                                                    ok            
14> {ok,Conn}=mongo:connect(localhost).                                         {ok,{connection,{"localhost",27017},<0.80.0>,infinity}}
15> mongrel:do(safe, master, Conn, tumblelog, fun()->                           15> mongrel:count(#post{tags= {'$in', [<<"mongodb">>]}})                        15> end).                     
{ok,1}
</pre>
